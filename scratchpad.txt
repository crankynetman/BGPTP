Send Data:
    - Convert File Data to IPv6 Prefix
        - Convert file to binary
        - Generate 16 bit file key
        - Split binary into 110 bit chunks, keeping track of the order of the chunks
        - Convert each chunk into IPv6/128 address format
        - [Global Prefix] + [File Key] + [Chunk Data]
        - Render each chunk index into a chunk index BGP community in the Type 2 TLV format
        - This will result in a list/dictionary of /128 prefixes, each with one community in the Type 2 TLV format applied to the prefix.
    - Convert file name/path to BGP Community
        - Convert file name/path to binary (ASCII)
        - Split file name/path into 8 bit chunks, keeping track of the order of the chunks (index)
        - Render the file name/path as a list of BGP communities, each community in the Type 1 TLV format. 
    - Prepare the prefixes for BGP
        - Take the list of marshalled prefixes and apply the file name/path community list to each prefix.
    - Advertise Prefixes with BGP
        - Insert prefixes into the BGP RIB using ExaBGP.
Receive Data:
    - Use ExaBGP to pull the prefixes into Python.
    - Convert IPv6 prefixes to File data
        - Put all of the prefixes into a list with the Type 2 TLV community as the key, and /128 as the data
        - Convert each /128 back into binary
        - Put all Type 1 TLV communities into a list
        - Split the Type 1 TLVs into their Index/Data pair and put into list
        - Reconstruct the Type 1 TLV list into a single string, which represents the file name/path.
        - Reconstruct the prefix data into a single binary blob and then reconvert back to a file.


Community TLV structure

TLV(4 bits)    Value(28 bits)

Filename/path TLV (TLV 1)

0010:0000000000000000000000000000


Padding TLV (TLV 3)

TLV(4 bits)    number of bits prepended (28 bits, only up to 7 bits can be used as only there are only 110 total data bits in the prefix)

|--||---------------------------|

0011:0000000000000000000000000000


Reserved TLV (TLV 15) This TLV is not used, as it presents a possibility to conflict with the well known BGP communities.
